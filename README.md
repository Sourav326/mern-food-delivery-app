<p id="description">This is a food delivery application created using <strong>MERN</strong> Stack. The project includes Restaurant list, and a single Restaurant page with all its products list. We also have a filter to filter-out the restaurant list on the basis of rating, and area. Also, it has search functionality to search the Restaurant or product. We can add the products to the cart and remove the items from the cart or empty the full cart. Also, have a login page and registration page.</p>
